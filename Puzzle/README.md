# Barcamp Puzzles!

Barcamp 6 incorporated a puzzle game which played out throughout the day. Each attendee was assigned to a tribe (they were given an e-badge which flashed a team colour and had a coloured solder mask). The tribes had to recover an artifact of power and the information (scroll) to activate it. The clues available encouraged tribes to work individualistically (e.g. blaze vs terra), but each tribe would ultimately choose if they would activate the artifact for the benefit (?) of their tribe or for the benefit of all. Each tribe had a national newspaper and this was available from the newspaper stand during lunch - the newspaper contained a number of clues and backstory information.

A box (here-on called Pandora's Box) was placed in the main foyer during one of the talks. This box had a number of locks (key + combination). The box required much more working together between the tribes in order to remove all the locks. The box contained the writing "When you come, be prepared to share with barcampers. When you leave, be prepared to share it with the world." and the symbol for unity (each scroll had the symbol on it, as well as the other tribes symbols).

Listed below are the various puzzles that made up Barcamp 6.

## Artifact Locations
Each tribe's artifact was hidden in a different locations across campus. Each tribe's badge had a silkscreened clue on its rear revealing the location: Keynes duckpond (tribe flood),  Synapse-Soleil (tribe blaze), Wind-wall (tribe wind), Darwin's Primordial tree (tribe Terra).

## Scroll locations

Each artifact's body was able to be rotated. As you rotated the body the top lights on the artifact changed to a different pattern. The pattern's were unique to each artifact to preventing copying and to stop people knowing immediately knowing a tribes final decision. The scrolls revealed the different patterns and what they represented. Each tribe had their own scroll and this was hidden in a geocache maze puzzle box. These were covered with sand and painted to give a concrete look.

The scrolls were hidden near the artifact locations to limit the amount of walking required. The locations were:  Hymn (tribe flood),  Huella Humana (tribe blaze), Father Courage (tribe wind), Darwin Rose Garden (tribe Terra).

The location of the scrolls were revealed by placing a tribe specific card over a 'four time pad'. The text location clue would then be revealed by looking at the pad from a distance.

Each tribe's newspaper also gave a clue to another tribes scroll location.  These clues were always in the same position on each paper and were incorporated into the article's title. E.g. "Hymn - Thousand singers join to celebrate anniversary of the Emperor's coronation", "Father Courage - Rev. heralded for bravery", etc.

### Combination lock "2d"

Pandora's Box had a combination lock on it with a disc and engraving "2d". The combination lock had a 5 button code and it did not matter the order the code was entered in. The code was "23847". Each tribe's newspaper had a different price on it (e.g. "3d") and the engraving disk was the clue to use this information (and also gave one of the required numbers).

### Combination lock

Each tribe's room had a small piece of Banksy art. The art was always placed on the whiteboard corner nearest the presenter's desk. The art was related to each tribe's "darkside". On the reverse of the art was a greek symbol which represented the code position and roman numerals for the actual code.

### Key lock

Because of an influx of late sign-ups we laser cut a set of badges using the badge outline file that I had prepared earlier for the event. Each badge had a unique character on it and position. When readout, it revealed a clue to the location of the key - "WOOLF_OUTSIDE_BINS". The key was hidden in a fake screw on one of the bins.

# The Message
Whilst the puzzle was to add a little bit of competitive and co-operative fun to Barcamp 6's lunch and time between talks, it also had central message - "That if we do not share our knowledge and wealth, we would ultimately be lead to our doom".

Essentially each tribe started working out for themselves and had their own national politics -- somewhat skewed to the extreme. The evidence of this was shown in each national newspaper --  the terra tribe was clearly totalitarian (1984 style references), blaze was expansionist, wind was xenophobic, and flood was focused on capitalistic gain. Whilst the overall theme of each newspaper incorporated the politics into it, the corner article on each paper clearly demonstrated this, e.g. "You won't be settled in Airia! -- with ministers taking a tough new stance on migrants to protect our jobs, resources and culture!". 

The bansky art in each room was also a mock to this state of affairs, for example, flood's was an image of a young girl being grabbed by a claw protruding from a cash machine ("money controls us"), blaze had an image of a girl hugging a nuke ("the horror of war next to the innocence and purity of the young girl â€“ good and evil unified and questioned as to why we inherently indulge in war and fighting when peace can be all around us."), terra was surveillance officers listening to a phone booth ("the surveillance powers used/requested in the name of protecting us"), and wind's was a group of fat pigeons demanding a small African swallow stays away and keep's off their worms ("those that have so much readily turn away those with so little").

Upon opening Pandora's Box, beneath the slogan and unity symbol was stored a number of real-life pieces; intended to parody the story of each tribe into real life. Flood had a picture of a turtle whose shell had been deformed from a lifetime of being trapped in a piece of plastic ("we readily consume more than we need, without thinking the pain & suffering it can cause when we discard it"), blaze had a list of drone-strike kill counts which included civilian numbers ("war and fighting, regardless of its reasons, brings suffering to the innocent"), terra had a list of books that had been challenged/banned in the US in 2018 ("we fear what message materials might convey, and seek to hide it rather than to challenge?/discuss it"), and air had a photo of a young dead child being carried up a beach by a Turkish soldier, the child had died when their migrant boat had capsized whilst fleeing a war-zone ("Ultimately we are all people. But why do we readily turn our backs, despite having so much?"). 

The aim of the barcamp puzzle was to give the attendees the choice of taking things for themselves (and ultimately bring about their doom) or to choose to share their power with everyone else unconditionally (and bringing about a new age of greatness).

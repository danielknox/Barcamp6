Gerbers should contain the ready to go files, schematics contains the Eagle board files.

Fabrication:
I used SEEEDSTUDIO for board fabrication.

For production, Barcamp stencil was used with bi-directional engraving on laser cutter using OHP asertate. Laser outline was used to create a simple nested jig (0.1mm offset).
Use ducktape to secure acertate to jig and paste away!

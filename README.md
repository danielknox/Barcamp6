Puzzle and Badges for Barcamp 6

Barcamp 6's theme was loosely based around the film The Fifth Element. Throughout the day a puzzle game played out for the 50+ attendees. In this repo are the files that made up the game. 

The badges, given to each attendee, are used to provide a clue to each tribe to locate their artefact and are used as part of the end sequence animation. They also fade their lights in/out approximately every 8 seconds (which looks quite cool when people are speaking/sitting in groups). 

The pcbs and puzzles took about two months to develop and produce. 

Special thanks to: 
Keith Greenhow (helped develop a number of the puzzles -- like the fourtime pad
Martin Falkner (for helping to assemble 40+ pcbs!)
